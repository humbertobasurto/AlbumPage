The second website featured was inspired by an actual auto auction website that used Wix to design and deploy it. I thought it 
would be a good challenge to try and emulate the site as best as I could and even make some changes of my own to make the 
funcitonality and design better. The I mainly emulated the original website layout and I changed everything else by making my 
own logo, color scheme, and adding mobile functionality and responsiveness that the original lacked. This website, with a couple 
of small changes, can be fully funcitonal and be deployed for any real company but I will not be working on it's backend or additional
functionality(google maps api) as it was made mostly for fun and as a challenge to myself. This project is considered done and shelved.

The last website is my latest creation and although it is still in it's early phase of design I wanted to showcase it as it will be my
first use of CSS grid which is really fun and intuitive to use as opposed to all the floats I had to use in my previous projects. My 
plan for this will be a real website that functions as a shuffled playlist. I will be using the Spotify developer API to add song
funcitonality. The main gist of the site will be that a music conosseaur can go to the site and find new music to listen to. The albums
will appear scattered on the screen or in a neat row depending on user preferences after which they can click on the art and start 
playing the music that coincides with the album art. Afterwards if they like the music they can add it automatically to their spotify
playlist or click the shuffle button which will generate 10 new albums to listen to for the listener. Expect this site to get regular updates.
